# dbpdlnmpv - Database: Playlist Download and mpv

dbpdlnmpv is an evolution of [pdlnmpv](https://github.com/duartqx/pdlnlink/blob/main/pdlnmpv) that uses a [sqlite](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) database to manage local playlists in conjunction with [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/). Dmenu is a straightforward tool for creating simple menus. Simply pipe something into it, and it will display as a menu on the screen. It is used in this case to show the user read and select operations.
